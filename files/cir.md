# ðŸ”µ Circle Properties for Beginners

## Basic Terms

| **Term**            | **Definition**                                                                 | **Formula / Notes**                         |
|---------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| **Radius (r)**      | Distance from the center to any point on the circle.                           | `r = d Ã· 2`                                  |
| **Diameter (d)**    | Distance across the circle, passing through the center.                        | `d = 2 Ã— r`                                  |
| **Circumference (C)** | Distance around the circle (the perimeter).                                    | `C = Ï€ Ã— d` or `C = 2 Ã— Ï€ Ã— r`               |
| **Ï€ (Pi)**          | A special number used in circle math, approx. 3.14 or 22/7.                    | Use Ï€ in formulas.                           |
| **Area (A)**        | The amount of space inside the circle.                                         | `A = Ï€ Ã— rÂ²`                                 |

| **Term**              | **Definition**                                                                 | **Notes**                                    |
|-----------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| **Chord**             | A line segment joining two points on the circle.                              | Shorter than or equal to the diameter.       |
| **Secant**            | A line that cuts through the circle at two points.                            | Extends beyond the circle.                   |
| **Tangent**           | A line that touches the circle at exactly one point.                          | Perpendicular to the radius at the point of contact. |
| **Arc**               | A part of the circle's circumference.                                         | Can be measured in degrees or length.        |
| **Sector**            | A portion of the circle enclosed by two radii and an arc.                     | Like a pizza or pie slice.                   |
| **Segment**           | The region between a chord and the arc above it.                              | Not a full sector.                           |
| **Center**            | The exact middle point of the circle.                                         | Often labeled as point O.                    |
| **Annulus**           | The ring-shaped area between two concentric circles.                          | Like a donut shape.                          |
| **Concentric Circles**| Two or more circles that share the same center but have different radii.      | Like a target or ripple.                     |
